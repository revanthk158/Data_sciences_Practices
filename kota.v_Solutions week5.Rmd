** 1. (10 points) Add a new column `Season1Days` that contains the number of days a market is opened per week (for the dates it is open). **

```{r}  
weaksdays <- c( "Mon" , "Tue", "Wed","Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")  

pattern <- str_c(weaksdays , collapse = "|")  
# Using the vector and collapse function, created a regular expression  
# to count the number of patterns (days) matching in the dataset.  
# Using count function. 
 
fmarket <-  fmarket %>%
  mutate(season1days = str_count(Season1Time , pattern ))  
#Mutate to add new column season1days to dataset representing  
#the number of days the market is open a week.
head(fmarket, 5)
```  
**2. (10 points) Add a new column `WeekendOpen` indicating whether a market opens during weekeneds.**  
```{r}  
fmarket <- fmarket %>%
  mutate(WeekendOpen = str_count(Season1Time , "Sat|Sun"))  
# Here used count function to count how many times  
# Sat, Sun patterns repeat in dataset to count    
# Number of days a market is open during weeekends.  
# Here the result int the new column WeekendOpen will be 0,1,2 
# 0 - Market not open during weekend
# 1 - The market opens only one day during weekends.
# 2 - The market opens both the days during weekends.

**3. (20 points) Find out which markets close before 6PM, and which open only for fewer than 4 hours a day. For simplicity, consider only `Season1Time`. For markets with different open hours across a week, use the average length of open hours for the days they actually open.**  
```{r}  
Q3V1 <- fmarket %>%
  select(MarketName,Season1Time)  
#To filter the markets that operate few hours than 4 hours  
# a day and close before 6PM, Selected only Market name and  
# Season1Time column to separate opening  
#and closing times from Season1Time column.

string2 <-str_replace_all(Q3V1$Season1Time,"^[A-Za-z:]+[ ]|^[A-Za-z]+[:]","")  
#first Step of seperating the times. Here we, replaced days  
# such as (Wed, Thurs) etc., with "" so that it becomes easy to  
# extract the opening time with a regular expression.
 string2.1 <- str_replace(string2,";","")  
 #2. Cleaned the tail (; that is seperating dates) so that it   
 # becomes easy to extract the closing time with a regular expression.

string3 <- str_extract(string2,"^[0-9]+[:][0-9]+[ ][A-Za-z]+")  
# extracting opening time using the regular expression (^).

q2v1 <- parse_time (string3, "%I:%M %p")  
# As the above vector string3 contains character type data
# used Parse_time function to convert the character type data to  
# time format.

string4 <- str_extract(string2.1 , "[0-9]+[:][0-9]+[ ][A-Za-z]+$")  
# Extracting the closing time using regular expression($).  

q2v2 <- parse_time ( string4, "%I:%M %p")  
# Used parse_time function to convert the character type of data to  
# time forma.t

z <- parse_time("6:00 PM")  
# Defined a new variable to z containing the time 6 PM. 

Q3V1$Season1Time <- string2.1  
# Assigned the vector which contains only opening and  
# Closing times to previously selected dataframe.

prac2<-mutate(Q3V1 , begin = q2v1, End = q2v2)  
# Prac2 is a new dataframe containing the opening and closing times.
# begin represents the begin time of market and  
# End represents the ending time of market.

r1 <- filter(prac2, abs(parse_time(begin)-parse_time(End)) < 14400 , parse_time(End) < z )  
# Here 144000 represents 4 hrs. as time difference is measured in seconds.
# z is a variable representing 6 PM.

**4. (40 Points) The seasons are not standardized and would make analysis difficult. Create four new columns for four seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter), indicating whether a market is available in that season. Also create two additional column `HalfYear` and `YearRound` to identify those who open across seasons. Define "half year" and "year round" on your own terms, but explain them before you write the code.**
